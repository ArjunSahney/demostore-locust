# AWS x Sedai Retail Demo Store Load Tests

Included in this repository are three Python files that use the Locust framework to load test the ECS, EKS, and Serverless deployment. The code will need to be adjusted with specific links to your own deployment and respective API calls. To deploy, simply run this command below: 

```
locust -f locust_test_name.py
```
